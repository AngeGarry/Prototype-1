# Prototype-1 (Create with Code)
## Unit 1 (My learning pathway of Unity's Junior Programmer)  
In this Unit, I learned to program a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, trying to avoid (or hit) obstacles in the way. In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, I learned how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming. By the end of this Unit, I am able to call basic functions, then declare and tweak new variables to modify the results of those functions. 

## Bonus
I Used the skills I learned in the driving simulation to fly a plane around obstacles in the sky.
