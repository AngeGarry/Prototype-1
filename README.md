# Prototype-1 (Create with Code)
## Unit 1 (My learning pathway of Unity's Junior Programmer)  
In this Unit, I learned to program a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, trying to avoid (or hit) obstacles in the way. In addition to becoming familiar with the Unity editor and workflow, I learned how to create new C# scripts and do some simple programming. By the end of this Unit, I am able to call basic functions, then declare and tweak new variables to modify the results of those functions. 
## Bonus
I can find bugs and try to debug my code from what I have learned in Unit 1.
